1. Adjust axis play (ball screw and linear guide adjustment)
   - x-axis
     Tighten the nut at the end of the ball screw with a size 8 open mouth wrench until it gets hard to rotate by hand. Untighten a bit so that it can be moved easily by hand, yet has neglicable amount of play.
     Tighten the grub screws (top and bottom) on the SFU1605 ballscrew with 1.4mm allen wrench slightly to reduce play. It must spin easily.
     Tighten the liear guides grub screws (top and sided) to tighten the fix the bearing within the bearing block. If tightened too much, carriage cannot move easily anymore.
   - y-axis
   - z-axis
3. Belted y-axis
